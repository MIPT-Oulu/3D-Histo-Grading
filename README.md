## Usage

### Preprocessing
Phosphotungstic acid -stained osteochondral samples can be preprocessed into mean and standard deviation images with script **run_images.py**

### Grading
Mean and standard deviation images can be used to calculate LBP images and estimate degeneration grades using script **run_grading.py**

### Full pipeline
These two steps are combined in script **run_full.py**

## License

This software and the pretrained models can be used only for research purposes
